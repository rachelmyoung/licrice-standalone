# licrice-standalone

This document describes the code and data necessary to reproduce the surface wind speed for the historical storm dataset from Hsiang et al. XXXX "Limited Information Cyclone Reconstruction and Integration for Climate and Economics (LICRICE)". 
A standalone package for the LICRICE tropical cyclone wind field model on historical IBTrACS tracks. Given a raw IBTrACS NetCDF (or Zarr) file plus a geographic region, it processes the tracks, estimates missing storm radii using RF, runs the wind fields model, and writes the output.

## Setup

All scripts are written in Python. Throughout this README, when indicating paths to code and data, it is assumed that you’ll execute scripts from the folder structure provided in this repository using Python 3.9 or greater.

## Replication Process

### Install packages

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/licrice-standalone.git 
cd licrice-standalone
pip install -e .
```

Dependencies (`numpy`, `xarray`, `pandas`, `dask`, `zarr`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, `beautifulsoup4`, `tqdm`, `netCDF4`, `bottleneck` ) are declared in `pyproject.toml` and installed automatically.

Create directories for the IBTrACS input data and LICRICE outputs:

```bash
mkdir -p data/raw
mkdir -p data/output
```

### Data retrieval from the IBTrACs portal

Download International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) [v04r01] dataset from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) with:

```bash
python - <<'EOF'
from licrice.io.ibtracs import download
download(
    url="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/international-best-track-archive-for-climate-stewardship-ibtracs/v04r01/access/netcdf/",
    outdir="data/raw/",
)
EOF
```

Or manually from [NOAA IBTrACS](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive).

### Run LICRICE to construct storm wind swaths

The entire pipeline for all of the domains (areas of the global, see below for additional details) can be run from the master workflow with the following bash:

```bash
# Standard run (recommended)
python run_licrice.py \
    --input data/raw/IBTrACS.ALL.v04r01.nc \
    --domain all \
    --outdir data/output/
```

If instead you wish to run the pipeline for specific domains or if you wish to run part of the pipeline, you can also run the following bash commands.

```bash  
# Run selected domains
python run_licrice.py \
    --input data/raw/IBTrACS.ALL.v04r01.nc \
    --domain north_atlantic_southwest western_pacific_south \
    --outdir data/output/

# Advanced options: If you already have preprocessed tracks
python run_licrice.py \
    --input data/raw/IBTrACS.ALL.v04r01.nc \
    --domain north_atlantic_southwest \
    --outdir data/output/ \
    --no-overwrite-preproc

# Advanced options: Use an already-preprocessed Zarr directly
python run_licrice.py \
    --input data/raw/ibtracs_preprocessed.zarr \
    --domain north_atlantic_southwest \
    --outdir data/output/
```

### Command Line Interface (CLI) flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--input` | Path to raw IBTrACS `.nc` or preprocessed `.zarr` |
| `--domain` | One or more domain names, or `all` |
| `--outdir` | Output directory |
| `--preproc-zarr` | Custom path for the preprocessed zarr (default: `<outdir>/ibtracs_preprocessed.zarr`) |
| `--no-overwrite-preproc` | Skip preprocessing if the zarr already exists |
| `--no-overwrite-output` | Skip LICRICE run if the output zarr already exists |
| `--params` | Path to a custom LICRICE params JSON (default: `params/licrice/v1.1.json`) |
| `--storm-chunksize` | Storms per processing chunk (default 25) |
| `--list-domains` | Print all built-in domain names and bounds, then exit |

Each domain produces: `data/output/hazard_wind_licrice_hist_<domain>.zarr`

The first run processes the NetCDF (cleans tracks, trains RF radius models, saves to `ibtracs_preprocessed.zarr`). Only needs to be run once. Later runs with `--no-overwrite-preproc` skip straight to LICRICE.

### Available domains

Domains outlined below are geographically defined coastal regions used to organize the analysis. They do not correspond exactly to tropical cyclone basins and may span portions of multiple basins. Instead, domains were defined to capture all regions where tropical cyclones meaningfully affect land.

| Domain | Description |
|---|---|
| `south_atlantic` | Southern coast of Brazil and Uruguay |
| `east_pacific_north` | Western Canada and Southern Alaska |
| `east_pacific_southwest` | Hawaii |
| `north_america_northeast` | Eastern Canada and Northeastern US |
| `north_atlantic_southwest` | Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea |
| `north_america_south` | Mexico and Southwestern US |
| `north_america_west` | Western United States |
| `north_atlantic_east` | West Africa, Western Europe, Iceland |
| `western_pacific_south` | South China Sea, Philippine Sea |
| `western_pacific` | East China Sea, Sea of Japan |
| `western_pacific_north` | Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea |
| `south_pacific_central` | Western Polynesia |
| `south_pacific_northwest` | Northern Australia, Papua New Guinea |
| `south_pacific_southwest` | Southern Australia, New Zealand |
| `south_pacific_east` | Eastern Polynesia |
| `south_indian` | Southern Africa, South Indian Ocean islands |
| `north_indian` | Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea |
| `conus` | Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the US |

## Output
Each domain produces one Zarr file at `<outdir>/hazard_wind_licrice_hist_<domain>.zarr` with dimensions `(storm, y_ix, x_ix)`.

Coordinates
- `lat (y_ix)` — latitude of grid cell centers
- `lon (x_ix)` — longitude of grid cell centers
- `storm (storm)` — IBTrACS storm ID
- `x_ix (x_ix)` — x-direction grid index
- `y_ix (y_ix)` — y-direction grid index

Data variables
- `maxs (storm, y_ix, x_ix)` — maximum sustained wind speed (m/s, float32) experienced at each grid cell during a storm
- `pddi (storm, y_ix, x_ix)` — power dissipation density index per grid cell per storm (m³/s², float32), the integral of wind speed cubed over time
- `start_date (storm)` — storm start datetime

Grid cell size is 0.1° (configurable via the params JSON).


## Notes

This package is extracted from coastal-core-main and strips out the cloud I/O, GeoClaw surge model, damage estimation, and `Settings` configuration object. It is intended to run the IBTRACS to LICRICE pipeline locally without complicated dependencies.
